# From JavaScript to TypeScript

## History of JavaScript

- ECMAScript is the language specification that JavaScript is based on.

## Vanilla JavaScript's Pitfalls

- Developers often refer to using JavaScript without any significant language extensions or frameworks as "vanilla".

### Costly Freedom

- JavaScript runs code without checking if it will likely crash first.

### Loose Documentation

- Nothing exists in the JavaScript language specification to formalize describing what function parameters, function returns, variables, or other constructs in code are meant to be.

## TypeScript!

- TypeScript was created internally at Microsoft in the early 2010s then released and open sourced in 2012.

## Getting Started in the TypeScript

### Compiling Syntax

- TypeScript compiler compiles TypeScript syntax to JavaScript syntax.
- We can see compiled JavaScript code in [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).

## Getting Started Locally

- A _tsconfig.json_ file declares the settings that TypeScript uses when analyzing your
  code.
- Even though there was a type error in our code, the syntax was still completely valid. The TypeScript compiler will still produce JavaScript from an input file regardless of any type errors.
